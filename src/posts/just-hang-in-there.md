> Just hang in there
> You will get there
> It's fine to shed a little tear
> When things are just too much to bear <br>
> Just hang in there
> You will get there
> It's fine to share your fears and struggles
> With the people that you care

Lyrics for this song came to me in one of my lower moments. I just finished an exam, and was walking home in the dark in the middle of the winter to join a Zoom meeting. It's been a tiring and busy season, but as I trudged home, the words 'Just hang in there' were stuck in my head.

As I experimented with rhyming, the verses started to form: `"It’s fine to shed a little tear when things are just too much to bear"`, `"It’s fine to share your fears and struggles with the people that you care"`, an apt reflection of my feelings at that moment. A melody started to form as I continued to walk and by the time I arrive home I couldn't wait to find the right chords to the song in my mind.

The vibe of the song is quite influenced by [Jayesslee](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdAFRh3rxx0Q_xxkS2_N2PA)'s more jazzy songs like [Officially Missing You](https://open.spotify.com/track/47vHy3Z7oTrCyjHZmkKn4M?si=74f8b7f2c1b947f4) with a more bossa nova vibe. Here are two versions of the song produced so far:

PS. I've been trying to write verses to the chorus but have yet to find anything that really resonates. Do drop a comment below if you have any ideas!
