I'm still in the midst of figuring out the mood/vibe of this site, but a site definitely needs an original favicon. so I decided to experiment with a favicon generator at <https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/>. The end result is a favicon that looks like a Scrabble tile, which I felt was kinda apt. Scrabble tiles are a bit like a lego pieces. You can build words with them, rearrange them to make another word, there's endless possibilities! (well one can argue that the number of words are finite, but I'm optimistic that mankind will continue inventing words). Below are the settings that I used to generate the favicon (can also be accessed [here](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/?t=P&ff=Mako&fs=100&fc=%23222&b=rounded&bc=%23FDA)).
