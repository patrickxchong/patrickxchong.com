I was quite into the scrabble theme after making the favicon for this site and hence decided to build on it by creating scrabble theme headings! I believe it can be better/made more dynamic by making the padding sizes more responsive to the font size. That will be what I'll try to do next before incorporating it as a vue component on this site. Check the Codepen below for what I have right now:

<iframe height="288" style="width: 100%;" scrolling="no" title="Scrabble Text" src="https://codepen.io/patrickxchong/embed/mdeLLjo?height=288&theme-id=dark&default-tab=css,result" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true">
