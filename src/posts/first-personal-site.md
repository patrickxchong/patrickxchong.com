Yay I finally have a personal site! :D

Been on my mind for a good number of years now. I did some digging and found a template at <https://github.com/Gomah/bluise> that uses NuxtJS, Tailwind CSS and Netlify CMS. I'm familiar with Nuxt/Vue.JS and have been wanting to get my hands dirty with Tailwind CSS and Netlify CMS, so this is a pretty cool opportunity. Looking forward to playing around with the site more!
