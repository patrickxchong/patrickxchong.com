All platforms have a free tier, with different limitations.

### Website + API + Database

- [Deta](https://www.deta.sh/) - Totally free. Something quite new that I found out, still exploring and built a couple of prototypes with it. Apparently they will have an [alternative way to generate revenue](https://docs.deta.sh/docs/home#how-are-you-going-to-make-money).
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) (if we consider Google Sheets as a database) (Javascript only)
- [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) (JavaScript only)
- [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) (Python only)

### Website + API

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/patrickxchong)
- [Netlify](https://netlify.app/)

### Database + Static File Storage

- [Supabase](https://supabase.io/)

### Database only

- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)

### Website only

- [Surge](https://surge.sh/)

### DNS service

- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/)

### Online IDEs

- [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/)
