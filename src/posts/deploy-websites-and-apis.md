Personally have tried most of the platforms here. All platforms have a generous free tier, with different limitations.

### Website + API + Database

- [Deta](https://www.deta.sh/) - Totally free. Something quite new that I found out, still exploring and built a couple of prototypes with it. Apparently they will have an [alternative way to generate revenue](https://docs.deta.sh/docs/home#how-are-you-going-to-make-money).
- [Fly](https://fly.io/) - generous free plan, able to host three servers with Heroku style buildpacks or using docker, 3GB storage/postgres databases, no slow-startup issue
- [Railway](https://railway.app/) - generous free plan, able to host 2-3 postgres databases and servers
- [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) (if we consider Google Sheets as a database) (Javascript only)
- [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) (JavaScript only)
- [Render](https://render.com/) - very limited free plan, PG database expires after 90 days, not recommended

### Website + API

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - Currently most of my projects are hosted here thanks to Vercel's generous free plan, this website is on hosted Vercel too!
- [Netlify](https://netlify.app/)

### Database + Static File Storage

- [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) (PostgreSQL)

### Database only

- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) (NoSQL)
- [Grist](https://www.getgrist.com/) (Spreadsheet-like)
- [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/pricing) (Spreadsheet-like)

### Website only

- [Surge](https://surge.sh/)

### DNS service

- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/)
  - Also has [free SSL](https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl/) service

### Online IDEs

- [CodePen](https://codepen.io/)
- [CodeTasty](https://codetasty.com/pricing)
- [CodeSandBox](https://codesandbox.io/)
- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
- [Repl.it](https://replit.com/)
- [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/)
